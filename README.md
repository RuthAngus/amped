Exploring amplitude of variability in light curves to predict ages

TO DO:
1. Try to reproduce Rper from Amy's paper. Also, just calculate overall Rvar.
2. Download light curves for the kinematics-and-rotation sample and calculate
   their variability amplitudes.
3. Download light curves for a sample of stars in Amy's non-periodic catalog
   and try to predict their rotation periods using Lucy's method or linear
   regression.
   Then try to calculate their Rper.
4. Could try something similar with cluster stars, but they will be young.
5. Could try something similar with asteroseismic stars, but they will be
   evolved.
